## Description

In this Python project, we will be utilizing the decision tree algorithms from the scikit-learn library on a salary dataset obtained from the Census Bureau. This project was done in a Python notebook file, in which we prepared the data for modelling, constructed several decision tree models, and made a prediction using the "best" model that we constructed. The notebook goes more in depth concerning the code and algorithms used in this assignment.
