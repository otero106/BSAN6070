## Description

In this Python project, we will be replicating a movie recommender system on a smaller scale using a K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm. This project was done in a Python notebook file, in which we imported a subset of an IMDB movie dataset, constructed the kNN model, and test the model by inputting a film and having the model display five recommendations. The notebook goes more in depth concerning the code and algorithms used in this assignment.
